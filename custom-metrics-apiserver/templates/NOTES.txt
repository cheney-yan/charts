This chart is an application of the Custom Metrics API as documented in https://github.com/DirectXMan12/k8s-prometheus-adapter

It requires a prometheus installation to be active and running at http://{{- .Values.prometheus.service.name -}}.{{- .Values.prometheus.namespace -}}.svc:{{- .Values.prometheus.service.port -}}/

It will then create a custom-metrics API server in order to permit the creation of HPAs based on custom metrics, such as number of hits on an API.
